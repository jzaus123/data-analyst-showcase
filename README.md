# **Producing two prediction models**
- Model one is aim to predict the total daily energy usage based on the provided weather dataset. 
- Model two is aim to predict the maximum daily price category based on the provided weather dataset. 

## Getting Started

### Dependecies
- Python libraries - Pandas and Scikit-learn
-  Python modules - Data-cleaning function

### Model Execution process 
- Step one - Importing Python libraries
- Step two - Loading the two datasets
- Step three - Applying Data-cleaning module to clean datasets
- Step four - Data preparation - merging two datasets into dataframe for analysing
- Step five - Determining features for producing models - Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient & Mutual Information
- Step six - Defining deoendent and independant variables for training and testing data
- Step seven - Defining algorithms - Regression for numeric outputs & Classification for categorical outputs
- Step eight - Looking for a feature conbimation to compute best model evaluation - R - Squared / Accuracy
